# nuxeo-fontoxml

### WARNING
This is **Work In Progress**. Using GitHub as backup for now.

## About
nuxeo-fontoxml is a _Proof of Concept_, a plugin allowing for editing XML file within Nuxeo, using the [FontoXML Editor](https://www.fontoxml.com) and its support for DITA documents.

As it is Work In Progress, here is a very quick unordered list of features/ToDo:

* A build of FontoXML must be deployed on your server, it cannot be included in the Marketplace PÃ¤ckage of the plugin.
  * Easiest way is to just drop it in `nxserver/nuxeowar/ui`.
  * In the following example/doc, we named the folder containing the FontoXML distribution `FontoXML`, so we have:

```
nxserver
  nuxeo.war
    ui
      FontoXML
        assets
        index.html
        . . .
```

* We call it after embedding Fonto in an iFrame
  * WARNING: We do not use the Fonto XML iFrame Connector, we use the Standard Connector, that makes HTTP requests to Nuxeo

* We recommend setting `autoSave` to false when initializing the Fonto Editor, it sends a lot of request (2 seconds after each edit.
  * Fonto allows for detecting it's "auto save" so we can optimize the database load, maybe, but still. Saving every n seconds does not really scale. => In this POC it will work, because you usually test a POC on very few documents :-)

* Now a not-really-started, not-finished :-) and _unordered_ list of items in the context of this POC
  * **Implemented endpoints** (see `FontoXMLServlet`):
    * (**IMPORTANT REMINDER**: This is a POC implementation, not a final product)
    * `GET /document`
    * `GET /asset/preview`
    * `GET /heartbeat`
    * `POST /browse`
    * `POST /document/state`
    * `PUT /document`
    * `PUT /document/lock`
  * This POC does not implement versioning policy. This should be done in final product (when to create version(s) automatically, likely a configuration parameter)
  * We don't really make usage of `editSessionToken` and `revisionId`
  * Locking is done per Fonto request. So, if the document was already locked and Fonto asks us to unlock it at some point, we do unlock it.
    * This will likely need to be optimize in the final product
    * Also, Fonto sends a POST /document/state to get lock info: A custom build requiring this info less often would be good, and the POC just return cached info, we don't re-calculate the lock every time Font is asking us.
  * When **browsing Nuxeo**:
    * _We only handle default document types_ ("File", "Picture", ...) <br/> => Room for improvement and configuration in a final product to handle custom document types, if any.
    * This POC **does not handle pagination** (as the POST /browse end point parameters could allow)
    * Also, we **assume an XML Blob always has "text/xml" mime-type**
    * We do not handle a "document-template" type in the context of this POC.
    * We ignore the "sort" parameter => always sorting by title (this also could be configuration)
    * **This POC assumes the user can READ root/domain/etc.**
  * Rarely returns a 403, not authorized. Nuxeo policy is that if a user can't read a document, they should not even know it exists. So, when trying to access a document a 404 is returned. Some Fonto API requires a 403.
  * Maybe pre-calculated renditions should be calculated for FontoXML's rendition of related asset. It requires thumbnail of 128x129 and "web" rendition of max 1024. In this POC, we get the thumbnail (so it's easy and done in one line of code) and resize it accordingly. This is not optimized at all.
  * **No unit test**
  * Simultaneous loading of several documents is not implemented (this POC always loads one by one)
  * Idea of usage for the `documentContext`: Add a boolean that will give the lock state of the document at first load. So if it was already locked, we don't release the lock when asked by Fonto (but tell it it was released)
  * . . .

**These features are not part of the Nuxeo Production platform, they are not supported**

These solutions are provided for inspiration and we encourage customers to use them as code samples and learning resources.

This is a moving project (no API maintenance, no deprecation process, etc.) If any of these solutions are found to be useful for the Nuxeo Platform in general, they will be integrated directly into the platform, not maintained here.
